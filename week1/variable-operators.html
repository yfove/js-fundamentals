        //EXERCISE 1
        //1. ask a user for their age
        const years = prompt("What is your age?");

        //2. Store the answer and convert their age age into seconds
        const seconds = 60;
        const minutes = 60;
        const hour = 24;
        const day = 30;
        const month = 12;
        const ageInSeconds = seconds * minutes * hour * day * month * years;
        //3. Log into the console their age in seconds
        console.log(ageInSeconds);
        //4. Try concatenating the answer into sentence:
        console.log(`Your age in seconds is: ${ageInSeconds}`);

        //EXERCISE 2
        // Write some code that finds the youngest person out three ages

        function findmaxAge() {
            const num1 = parseInt(prompt("Age of person1: "));
            const num2 = parseInt(prompt("Age of person 2: "));
            const num3 = parseInt(prompt("Age of person 3: "));
        
        // Log into the console the sentence: the youngest perosn is -- years old.
        console.log(`the youngest person is ${Math.min(num1,num2,num3)} year old`);
        
        // EXERCISE 4
        // Write some code that returns a random number between 1 and 100.
            const random = Math.floor(Math.random()*100) + 1;
        // Log into the console the sentence: Your random number is --.
        console.log(`your random number is ${random}`);
        // Bonus points for returning a whole number (no decimals).
        // Hint: Look into Math.random and Math.round

        // EXERCISE 5
        // Write some code that adds sales tax to a price.
        const price = prompt("Price of item is: ");
        const taxRate = 1.08;
        // Log into the console the sentence: "The total price with tax is $--."
        const total = price *  taxRate;
        // Bonus points if you can get it to show 2 decimals. (Google it!)
